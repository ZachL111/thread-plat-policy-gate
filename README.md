# thread-plat-policy-gate

`thread-plat-policy-gate` treats platform engineering as a local verification problem. The Java implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Thread Plat Policy Gate Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## What This Is For

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## Architecture Notes

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Java implementation uses a compact package layout and direct assertion checks.

## Case Study

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Useful Pieces

- Uses fixture data to keep route policy changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for rollout constraints, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents environment checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Tooling

The only required setup is the local Java toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Scope

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Expansion Ideas

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more platform engineering fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
